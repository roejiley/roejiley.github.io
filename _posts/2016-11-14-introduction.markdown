Graduating in 2013 from a vocational school, I dove into the construction field through a school-to-work program and began remodeling houses. Although the money was great, I never truly enjoyed the work. Helping people build their dream home and making ideas and plans become reality is something I do enjoy, but the constant stress on your body and working outside in all weather conditions is something that never appealed to me.

Over the past few years, I tried several other fields. I worked at an apartment complex preparing units for new move-ins for close to a year, and even joined the local Carpenters' Union for a short time. Now I'm working on robots and conveyors in a distribution center, and while it's a lot more interesting to me than my previous jobs, I'm still not satisfied with my job position.

Wanting to build websites for a living all started out with working on a house in a pretty wealthy area where the homeowner worked from home. He was a consultant for a pretty big web design firm. It peaked my interest in coding and led me to do some research on becoming a programmer.

A few weeks later, I decided to go to college at the age of 21 for Computer Science. While it was cool, the outdated program was teaching me Visual Basic and I just wasn't too interested. In the meantime, I joined FreeCodeCamp and CodeCademy and started teaching myself HTML and CSS in my free time.

One year later, I switched my major to Website Development for e-Commerce. Luckily, all but one class transferred so it didn't push me back that much. This is where I stand now - in college for web development and learning as much as I can in my free time. Since then, I've taken courses on SCSS, Javascript, Wordpress, JQuery, and Jekyll - which is what I used to build this site.

I'm excited to see what the future has in store for me.
